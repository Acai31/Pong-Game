# Pong Project
Saw an oppurtunity to improve on the classic Pong game based on freeCodeCamp's tutorials.   
Some features added, but not limited to: 
- ending the game when a player first reaches 7 points
- having an end game screen
- automatically closing the game window when game is done

Movement Controls:   
    Player A: W, S   
    Player B: Up Key, Down Key
